The Amazon Price Check Web Scraping Project automates the retrieval of product prices from Amazon.com using Python and BeautifulSoup. Designed for efficiency and convenience, this project enables users to monitor specific products on Amazon without manual intervention. By leveraging web scraping techniques.

Key Features:

Automated Price Monitoring: The script accesses Amazon.com and retrieves current prices for specified products. This eliminates the need for manual checking and allows for regular updates.

Customizable Product List: Users can easily modify the list of monitored products by editing the script. Each product is associated with its Amazon URL, ensuring flexibility.

Email Notifications: For enhanced user convenience, the script can be configured to send email alerts when significant price changes are detected. This feature keeps users informed in real-time, making it easier to capitalize on deals and price drops.

Flexible Output Options: Extracted data, including product names and prices, can be displayed in the console or saved to a file for further analysis. This versatility caters to different user preferences and analysis needs.

How It Works:

Scraping Mechanism: Utilizing BeautifulSoup, the script parses HTML to extract relevant price information directly from Amazon's product pages.

Email Alerts: Integration with Python's SMTP libraries enables automated email notifications. Users can specify thresholds for price changes that trigger alerts, ensuring timely updates.

User Interaction: The script's setup is user-friendly, allowing users to easily add or remove product URLs based on their monitoring requirements. This ensures personalized monitoring tailored to individual needs.

Legal and Ethical Considerations:
Terms of Service: Users must adhere to Amazon's terms of service regarding web scraping activities. Responsible usage includes ensuring compliance with legal guidelines and respecting Amazon's policies.

Performance Optimization: To maintain reliable performance and avoid IP blocking, users should configure the script to make requests at reasonable intervals and avoid excessive traffic to Amazon's servers.
